Here I am analyzing data from a digital media store

WHERE Country <> 'USA';

2.Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country 
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

3.Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT invoices.CustomerID, invoices.InvoiceId, customer.FirstName,
customer.LastName, invoices.InvoiceDate, invoices.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices as invoices
LEFT Join chinook.customers as customer

WHERE invoices.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

4.Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

where Title ='Sales Support Agent';

5.Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT distinct BillingCountry FROM chinook.invoices;

6.Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
Select inv.InvoiceId, em.FirstName, em.LastName
from chinook.employees as em
left join chinook.customers as cust 
on cust.SupportRepId=em.EmployeeId
left join chinook.invoices as inv
on inv.CustomerId=cust.CustomerId;

7.Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, emp.FirstName, 
emp.LastName, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees as emp
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust
ON emp.employeeId= cust.SupportRepId
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices as inv
on inv.customerId=cust.CustomerId;

8.How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT count(*) FROM chinook.invoices

--ON i.TrackID=t.TrackID
--INNER JOIN chinook.albums as a
--ON a.AlbumID=t.AlbumID
--LEFT JOIN chinook.artists as ar

ON inv.customerid=cust.customerid
where emp.title= 'Sales Support Agent'
group by emp.FirstName;

14.Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT emp.firstname, emp.lastname, sum(inv.total) as 'total sales'
FROM chinook.employees as emp
