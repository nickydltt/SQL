# Here, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1. How many tracks did each artist have in the spotify data?
select artist_name, count(artist_name) from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
group by artist_name

#2. Which tracks by which artist are the most popular?
select artist_name, track_name, popularity from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
order by popularity desc

#3. Which artist had the longest song?
select artist_name from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
order by duration_ms

#4. Which artists and tracks had a 0.8% dancability
select artist_name, track_name from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
where danceability like "%0.8%"
