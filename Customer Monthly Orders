- In this SQL, I'm querying a database to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

(#1. How many orders were placed in January?)
select count(orderID) from BIT_DB.JanSales where length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'order ID'
 
(#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?)
select count(orderID) from BIT_DB.JanSales where product = 'iPhone'
and length (orderID)=6 and orderID <> 'Order ID'

(#3.Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.)
select acctnum from BIT_DB.customers
inner join BIT_DB.FebSales
on BIT_DB.customers.order_id=BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID
where length(orderID)=6
and orderID <> 'Order ID'

(#4.Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?)
select distinct product, price from BIT_DB.JanSales ORDER BY price 
asc limit 1

(#5.What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?)
select product, sum(price) * quantity FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
group by product order by sum(price) * quantity desc 

(#6.Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?)
select product, sum(price) *quantity from BIT_DB.FebSales 
where location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
group by product

(#7.How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?)
select count(BIT_DB.customers.acctnum), avg(quantity*price) from BIT_DB.FebSales
join BIT_DB.customers
on BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID=BIT_DB.customers.order_id
where BIT_DB.FebSales.Quantity>2
and length(orderID)=6
and orderID<> "Order ID"

(#8.List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.)
select product, sum(quantity) from BIT_DB.FebSales
where location like '%Los Angeles%'
group by product

(#9.Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?)
select location, count(orderID) from BIT_DB.JanSales
where location like '%NY%'
group by location having count(orderID) >2

(#10.How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?)
select product, sum(quantity) from BIT_DB.FebSales
where product like '%headphones%'
group by product

(#11.What was the average amount spent per account in February?)
select sum(quantity*price)/ count(BIT_DB.customers.acctnum) 
from BIT_DB.FebSales
left join BIT_DB.customers
on BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID=BIT_DB.customers.order_id

(#12.What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?)
select sum(quantity)/ count(BIT_DB.customers.acctnum) 
from BIT_DB.FebSales
left join BIT_DB.customers
on BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID=BIT_DB.customers.order_id

(#13.Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?)
select product, sum(quantity *price) from BIT_DB.JanSales
group by product order by sum(quantity *price) desc limit 1
